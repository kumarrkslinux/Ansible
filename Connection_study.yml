"Forks" - Parallisam - number of simulantanious connection - By default 5  -  ancible.cfg

"Serial" - Rolling update - serial excution - expecially for Web servers 

Import and include main difference are:

All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed. - Loop will not work - run in the begining 
All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution of the playbook. - execute only runtime 
So import is static, include is dynamic.
